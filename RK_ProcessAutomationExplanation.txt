We can use the workflow rule and we can send an email from that but we need to create the email template and emailalert
and also we need to pass the static value for that because we can not get related records.

I have used autolaunchedflow why flow because its help us to send an email from that and we can create the dynamic email body. 
Second thing in which our scenario we need to get the related records so that related records we can get into the flow that
are not possible in workflowrule and also in this we can send Email to selected users only.

So thats why I have used Autolaunched flow which is called from prcocess builder.
